## Installation

### One-line install (recommended)

> **Check your distribution first:** the commands below are only for standalone environments that run DSH directly. If you installed `@linxin666/dsh-web-all` (dsh-web), install its adapted `maid-atelier-wj` and `orca-link-wj` through dsh-web's own skin center/installer instead. Do not add this repository's standalone packages to the same profile; the component and styling contracts differ and the resulting UI may be broken.

This repository ships **both skins** (`@wjingshan/dsh-client-ui-skin-maid-atelier` / `-orca-link`); they are **not published on npm yet**, so the one-line install below pulls them straight from this repository's `main` by subdirectory — **no clone required**, pnpm ≥ 9. **Install the skin manager from the upstream published package `@smalltailqwq/dsh-client-ui-skin-deep-whale-manager`** — this fork no longer ships its own manager.

**Linux / macOS / WSL:**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add '@smalltailqwq/dsh-client-ui-skin-deep-whale-manager'
dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:wjingshan/dsh-deep-whale#path:/maid-atelier'
dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:wjingshan/dsh-deep-whale#path:/orca-link'
```

**PowerShell** (use `;` between commands):

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add '@smalltailqwq/dsh-client-ui-skin-deep-whale-manager'
dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:wjingshan/dsh-deep-whale#path:/maid-atelier'
dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:wjingshan/dsh-deep-whale#path:/orca-link'
```

For a single skin, drop the line you do not need (keep skin-manager: switching and mutual exclusion rely on it).

This is a first-time package addition, so restart DSH once. On that restart the skin manager detects "two skins enabled at once" and **atomically falls back to the official default**, so a fresh install can never leave skins stacked; then open Settings → Skin Management and click Switch on your skin — hot reload applies it. Later switches need no restart and no AI assistance.

> Until the npm packages are published, these GitHub `#path:` specs are the only install source that needs no clone (pnpm ≥ 9). For pinned commits and local development, see [Standalone sub-package install](#standalone-sub-package-install-dev-and-weak-network-fallback). npm (once published), GitHub and local links are different sources for the same package names; the last `add` wins.

### Coexisting with the upstream packages (separated identity)

This fork's **plugin identity** is fully separated from upstream, so both distributions can live in one
profile without either skin shadowing the other:

| Identity | Upstream | This fork |
|---|---|---|
| npm package name | `@smalltailqwq/dsh-client-ui-skin-deep-whale-manager` (manager) / upstream scope + `dsh-client-ui-skin-maid-atelier` | `@wjingshan/dsh-client-ui-skin-maid-atelier` |
| `skin.json` `id` | `maid-atelier` | `maid-atelier-wj` |
| `wiring.id` (patch row id) | `ui-skin-maid-atelier` | `ui-skin-maid-atelier-wj` |
| `bodyAttr` | `data-dsh-maid-atelier` | `data-dsh-maid-atelier-wj` |

(The same `-wj` suffix applies to `orca-link`. Except for the manager row, the upstream npm scope is
deliberately not spelled out, because this repository's rename rules rewrite that literal.) The separation is
reapplied automatically after every upstream sync by `scripts/apply-fork-rename.py`; that file's comments
explain why `id`, `wiring.id` and `bodyAttr` must all be unique — the manager de-duplicates by `id` and
`wiringId` (later duplicates are dropped) and detects the active skin through `bodyAttr`.

**The manager is not identity-separated**: this fork no longer ships its own manager. Install the upstream
published `@smalltailqwq/dsh-client-ui-skin-deep-whale-manager` — it is generic (it discovers skins through the valid `skin.json` in the
profile's dependencies), so it manages this fork's skins as well. The `skin-manager/` directory here is kept
only as the **protocol source the skins compile against** and as an upstream mirror, with upstream's loader id;
nothing is distributed, so no second manager identity exists.


### Update

**Linux / macOS / WSL:**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update
```

**PowerShell** (quote `@`-prefixed tokens):

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web update
```

GitHub dependencies re-resolve the latest repository commit; npm dependencies (once published) follow `latest` and `update` re-resolves the version that tag points at. `dsh plugin --profile web update` can also run without a package name (updates every dependency in the profile; identical when only these packages are installed) — dependency keys are the `@wjingshan/*` package names, so the GitHub source and a future npm source share the one command. Bundle content updates hot-reload through config HMR; a restart is needed only when adding/removing plugin packages.

### Migrating from the old placeholder scope

GitHub installations made before `0.1.3` use `@dsh-external/*` dependency keys. That scope was only a source-level placeholder for this project. Remove all three old keys before running the one-liner above; otherwise DSH may retain both plugin identities:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove '@dsh-external/dsh-client-ui-skin-orca-link'
dsh plugin --profile web remove '@dsh-external/dsh-client-ui-skin-maid-atelier'
dsh plugin --profile web remove '@dsh-external/dsh-client-ui-skin-deep-whale-manager'
```

Restart DSH once after installing the new packages. Skin preferences remain keyed by the `maid-atelier-wj` / `orca-link-wj` skin ids and are not renamed with the npm scope.

### Can't be bothered? Let an AI install it

Paste this into any AI (or dsh itself). [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) is the standard entry point: the AI reads it and is led to the bundled `dsh-skin-install` skill — a plain install runs the same one-liner above, while legacy migration, local development and specified-commit flows follow the skill (staged mutual exclusion, absolute-path links, cold-start verification).

```
Read https://github.com/wjingshan/dsh-deep-whale/INSTALL.md and install the skins from this repository following its guidance
```

### Skin mutual exclusion (must read)

- First, a distinction: `skin-manager` is not a skin — it is the **skin manager** (discovery, switching and customization panels) and stays enabled permanently; mutual exclusion applies to the **skins themselves** — maid-atelier and orca-link.
- Skin enable/disable is controlled by patch layers: each of `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml` (profile layer) and `~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml` (home layer) carries `- id: <wiring.id>` + `disabled: true/false` rows (**both layers must be written**; the home layer outranks the profile layer).
- **A skin without a `disabled` row is enabled by default.** A single installed skin therefore works out of the box; installing both at once without ever switching leaves them running **simultaneously**: the decoration layers stack and the sidebar/settings area gets mangled. Typical symptoms: **settings button disappears, abnormal sidebar width/layout, chaotic UI** (the stock UI is fine).
- **skin-manager guards mutual exclusion**: the one-line install registers all three packages; on the first restart the manager merges the profile→home states and, if two or more skins would actually be enabled, atomically falls back to "Official default" and writes the exclusion rows. A legal zero-or-one-skin selection is never rewritten. No manual pre-staging is needed.
- skin-manager (Settings → Skin Management) writes the exclusion rows into both patch layers for you when activating; hand-editing “one skin only” requires **explicitly disabling every other skin**.
- With skin-manager installed, skin customization items (e.g. the "less anime mode" visibility schedule) are stored in the current browser and applied by the manager.

### Standalone sub-package install (dev and weak-network fallback)

> Regular users do not need this section: the GitHub one-liner needs no clone. This is for local development, specified-commit testing, or when the network is unavailable (including a first fetch of the repository snapshot that is too large). npm (once published)/GitHub specs and local links address the same package names — pick one and stick with it.

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wjingshan/dsh-deep-whale   # clone anywhere (shallow is enough, skips history)
node <abs path to clone>/.agents/skills/dsh-skin-install/scripts/stage-mutual-exclusion.mjs --profile web --target maid-atelier-wj
dsh plugin --profile web add <abs path to clone>/skin-manager   # persistent skin manager panel (recommended)
dsh plugin --profile web add <abs path to clone>/maid-atelier   # Abyssal Maid Atelier
dsh plugin --profile web add <abs path to clone>/orca-link      # ORCA LINK
```

> The `node` command is an **optional optimization**: staged before any `plugin add`, it makes the target skin the only enabled one so the first startup already shows it; it preserves unrelated YAML and never overwrites the whole patch. Skipping it is safe too — the skin-manager fallback returns to Official default on first startup, then switch in Settings → Skin Management. Use `--target orca-link-wj` for ORCA LINK or `--target official` for the stock UI.

**Option A (recommended): Settings → Skin Management → click Switch on the skin you want.** The manager writes the mutual-exclusion `disabled` rows to both patch layers and hot reloads; just refresh the page.

**Option B: hand-write both patch layers.** Append the following rows to **both** `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml` **and** `~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml` (both are required; the home layer overrides the profile layer):

```yaml
# Example: enable only maid-atelier; for orca-link move `false` to its row — exactly one of the two skins may be false
- id: ui-skin-maid-atelier-wj
  disabled: false
- id: ui-skin-orca-link-wj
  disabled: true
- id: ui-skin-deep-whale-manager
  disabled: false
```

> If the patch file is still dsh's default template (comments + a single `[]` line), **replace that `[]` line entirely with the list above** — "comments + `[]` + other rows" is invalid YAML and config parsing will fail (the server keeps the last good config running; fix the file and refresh).

Windows example (forward or back slashes both work; pnpm normalizes them):
```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add C:/Users/<you>/code/dsh-deep-whale/skin-manager
dsh plugin --profile web add C:/Users/<you>/code/dsh-deep-whale/maid-atelier
```

### Installed too many / something looks broken

Symptoms: the settings button disappears, the sidebar is covered by decoration or has an abnormal width, the UI looks chaotic (recovers once skins are disabled).

1. Open Settings → Skin Management and click "Official default" or any skin — the manager writes the exclusion rows and hot reloads; refresh to recover;
2. If the manager is unavailable (or the config file was already corrupted), run `stage-mutual-exclusion.mjs` above with `--target official` or the desired skin to recover both patch layers;
3. Or simply remove the packages you don't want: `dsh plugin --profile web remove <package>`, then re-check the exclusion rows.

### Relative path rules (common pitfall)

- Relative paths (`./`, `../`-prefixed) resolve against **the directory dsh was invoked from**, not the skin repository directory.
- **Never use a bare directory name**: `dsh plugin --profile web add maid-atelier` is treated as an npm package name, hits the registry and fails with a 404. Use `./maid-atelier` (when already inside the skin repo), `../dsh-deep-whale/maid-atelier` (when dsh-deep-whale is a sibling), or an absolute path.
- `../dsh-deep-whale/maid-atelier` after `cd <harness>` only works if **dsh-deep-whale is a sibling of your harness directory**; if you cloned elsewhere, the relative path links to the wrong place (the command succeeds silently but the skin does nothing). When in doubt, use an absolute path.

### Post-install verification

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web list          # should list all three @wjingshan/dsh-client-ui-skin-* packages
dsh --profile web --dump-config        # manager row disabled: false; skins mutually exclusive — exactly one false
```

> Right after the one-line install, **before the first restart**, what `--dump-config` shows depends on your patch layers: in a clean environment both skins have no exclusion rows yet (enabled by default — a normal transitional state; the skin-manager fallback rewrites the rows at the first restart). If the home layer already carries exclusion rows (you installed and later removed this skin series before), that state is simply reused. After the cold start, inspect the client roster in the browser console (configuration entries alone do not prove browser bundles were registered). The startup page must reference `/plugins/<real package name>/client.js` for the manager and the active skin; the carrier differs across DSH versions (older builds put it in the `window.__DSH_BOOT__` JSON, 0.1.1rc2+ uses direct `<script src>` tags), so this one-liner works on both:

```js
document.documentElement.outerHTML.match(/\/plugins\/@wjingshan\/[^"'\s]+/g) ?? []
```

It must contain the manager and the active skin package; disabled skins may be absent. Refresh the browser to see the skin; skin toggles go through config hot reload, so no dsh restart is needed (restart only when adding/removing plugin packages).

### Install failure troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ERR_PNPM_FETCH_404` | misspelled spec, unavailable network, or a bare standalone directory | copy the spec from the one-liner above; use absolute paths for development links |
| `The matching commit...` / cannot resolve ref | **pnpm < 9** — `#path:` subdirectory syntax unsupported | upgrade pnpm to ≥ 9 (`npm i -g pnpm@latest`) |
| `ERR_PNPM_EXOTIC_SUBDEP` | installing an aggregate "root package" that itself carries Git dependencies (pnpm 11 supply-chain policy; this repo ships no such package) | use the one-liner above to install both skins (manager: the upstream published package) |
| `pnpm not found on PATH` | pnpm missing from the environment | install pnpm (`npm i -g pnpm`) and retry |
| package listed but no effect on the page | skin is `disabled` (multi-skin mutual exclusion) or the browser was not refreshed | check `disabled` in `--dump-config`; refresh |
| PowerShell command truncated / errors | unquoted `#` starts a comment | always quote specs in single quotes |
